This is the first project from the freecodecamp.com course on responsive web development. 
This is the original website: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
The purpouse of this repository is to try to clone the tribute page, coding from scratch, and hone my web development skills.
This is the first project of many!
To compare both pages don't forget to set the zoom on both to 100%.
